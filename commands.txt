PM2
PM2 (Process Manager 2) is a fast and easy solution for hosting your Nuxt application on your server or VM.
To use pm2, use an ecosystem.config.cjs:
ecosystem.config.cjs

module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'NuxtAppName',
      port: '3000',
      exec_mode: 'cluster',
      instances: 'max',
      script: './.output/server/index.mjs'
    }
  ]
}


CHECK PORT:
Identify the process using port 3000. 
lsof -i :3000

Output:
COMMAND   PID    USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
node    21995 myissue   19u  IPv6 986387      0t0  TCP *:3000 (LISTEN)

Kill:
kill -9 21995

-9
The -9 is the signal number that corresponds to the SIGKILL signal in Unix-like operating systems. 
The SIGKILL signal is a special signal that forcefully terminates a process. 
It does not allow the process to perform any cleanup or 
handle the signal in any way â€“ it immediately terminates the process.
