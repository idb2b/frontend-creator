## PM2

PM2 (Process Manager 2) is a fast and easy solution for hosting your Nuxt application on your server or VM.
To use pm2, use an ecosystem.config.cjs:
ecosystem.config.cjs

```
module.exports = {
apps: [
{
name: 'NuxtAppName',
port: '3000',
exec_mode: 'cluster',
instances: 'max',
script: './.output/server/index.mjs'
}
]
}
```

```terminal
npm run build
```

## Check port:

Identify the process using port 3000.

```
lsof -i :3000
```

#### Output:

COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
node 21995 myissue 19u IPv6 986387 0t0 TCP \*:3000 (LISTEN)

Kill:

```
kill -9 21995
```

-9
The -9 is the signal number that corresponds to the SIGKILL signal in Unix-like operating systems.
The SIGKILL signal is a special signal that forcefully terminates a process.
It does not allow the process to perform any cleanup or
handle the signal in any way â€“ it immediately terminates the process.

## pm2 Restart process

Get Process ID. Remember to install pm2 globally

```
pm2 status
```

Restart Process. If process ID is 0

```
pm2 restart 0
```
