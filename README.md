## Process Manager

PM2 (Process Manager 2) is a fast and easy solution for hosting your Nuxt application on your server or VM.
To use pm2, use an ecosystem.config.cjs:
ecosystem.config.cjs

```
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: "NuxtAppName",
      port: "3000",
      exec_mode: "cluster",
      instances: "max",
      script: "./.output/server/index.mjs"
    }
  ]
};
```

```terminal
npm run build
```

## Check port:

Identify the process using port 3000.

```
lsof -i :3000
```

Kill:

```
kill -9 21995
```

-9
The -9 is the signal number that corresponds to the SIGKILL signal in Unix-like operating systems.
The SIGKILL signal is a special signal that forcefully terminates a process.
It does not allow the process to perform any cleanup or
handle the signal in any way â€“ it immediately terminates the process.

## pm2 Restart process

Get Process ID. Remember to install pm2 globally

```
pm2 status
```

Restart Process. If process ID is 0

```
pm2 restart 0
```
